# FAQ

## What is BRC721 ‚ùì

BRC721 is a decentralized and scalable protocol for creating unique collections on Bitcoin.

BRC721 is a decentralized and scalable protocol for creating unique collections on Bitcoin. Essentially, it allows for storing images off-chain while still ensuring safe transactions of the Ordinal. The ordinals are stored on-chain and the metadata is stored off-chain.
The metadata is stored on IPFS and the Ordinal is stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is similar to 95% of NFT collections, providing an alternative to the existing on-chain solution.

## Why is it the solution ‚ùì

BRC721 guarantees legitimate and verifiable collections for collectors. No prepayment is required; the collector pays for the asset while the collection creator collects the Sats. This eliminates the need for using a side chain to gather funds before paying exorbitant fees to inscribe the entire collection without knowing if the collection will sell out.

## How to inscribe ‚ùì

To inscribe, you will need to download Ordinal Safe and either import your existing seed phrase from your other hot wallet (Xverse or Unisat) or ensure you have enough Sats to inscribe your first BRC721.

## With so many different derivative chains of BRC721, how do I know this is the right one ‚ùì

This is the one and only BRC721 all other projects resembling the same name are derivatives.

## Are the images stored on-chain ‚ùì

Images are currently stored off-chain using [IPFS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/ipfs/) at the moment but there is a proposal shared [here](https://github.com/onchainguy-eth/brc721-docs/tree/on-chain-metadata) that proposes a change to BRC721 that permits for on-chain image storage.
