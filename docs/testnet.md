# Testnet

The primary purpose of the testnet is to provide a safe and separate environment for testing new features, upgrades, and changes to the BRC721 protocol. It allows creators to experiment with the BRC721 workflow, enabling them to test and refine their collections before deploying them on the live network (livenet). This testing phase helps reduce the risk of potential issues and ensures a smoother launch on the livenet.
