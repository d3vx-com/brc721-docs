# Minting page

To try out the protocol and minting experience, you can set up a [minting page](https://github.com/d3vx-com/minting-page-example) instance. It uses NextJS and TailwindCSS and is a good starting point for building your minting page. You can also use it as a reference for building your own minting page.

## Setup

1. Clone the [minting page](https://github.com/d3vx-com/minting-page-example) repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory `cd minting-page-example/`.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`. 
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Testnet

To test the minting page with the testnet, you should switch your Ordinalsafe wallet to the testnet and edit the `.env` file in the root directory.

## Deploy

You can deploy the minting page to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or any other hosting provider. Please, follow the [NextJS deployment guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more information or find a guide for your hosting provider.
